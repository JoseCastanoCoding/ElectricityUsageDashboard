# ElectricityUsageDashboard

Project Plan: Energy Usage Dashboard for Individual Consumers

I. Introduction

  * Purpose: To create a web application that allows individual consumers to view and manage their energy usage by tracking their meter readings from their utility company and any user-entered meter readings.
  * Objectives:
      1. Develop a user-friendly dashboard to display energy usage data.
      2. Store and manage meter readings in a SQL database.
      3. Use C# and MVC for the API and frontend development.
      4. Implement models for User, UtilityCompany, MeterReading, Fees, and Credits.

II. Requirements Analysis

  * User requirements:
      1. Ability to create an account and log in.
      2. Ability to link their utility company account.
      3. Ability to view and manage meter readings.
      4. Ability to view energy usage data and costs.
      5. Ability to enter manual meter readings.
  * Technical requirements:
      1. SQL database to store data.
      2. C# for API and MVC for frontend development.
      3. User authentication and authorization.
      4. Data visualization and reporting capabilities.
      
III. Design

  * Database design:
      1. Create tables for User, UtilityCompany, MeterReading, Fees, and Credits.
      2. Design relationships between tables and define keys.
  * API design:
      1. Create a C# API to manage data and interactions with the database.
      2. Define endpoints for user authentication and authorization.
      3. Implement endpoints for managing meter readings and energy usage data.
  * Frontend design:
      1. Use MVC to design the user interface.
      2. Implement responsive and user-friendly design.
      3. Implement data visualization and reporting capabilities.

IV. Implementation

  * Database implementation:
      1. Set up and configure the SQL database.
      2. Implement the database design.
  * API implementation:
      1. Implement the C# API according to the API design.
      2. Test and debug the API.
  * Frontend implementation:
      1. Implement the MVC frontend according to the frontend design.
      2. Test and debug the frontend.

V. Testing

  * Test the database and API to ensure they are functioning correctly.
  * Test the frontend to ensure it meets the user requirements and is visually appealing.
  * Conduct user acceptance testing to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

VI. Deployment

  * Deploy the application to a web server for production use.
  * Monitor the application and make necessary updates and improvements.
  
VII. Maintenance

  * Regularly monitor and update the application to ensure its continued functionality.
  * Address and resolve any bugs or issues reported by users.
  
VIII. Conclusion

  * The Energy Usage Dashboard for Individual Consumers project is a valuable tool for individuals to manage their energy usage and costs.
  * By implementing a SQL database, C# API, and MVC frontend, the application provides a robust and user-friendly solution for managing energy usage data.
